        All science textbooks purchased with state moneys must have the
        following notice placed prominently in them.

        This textbook discusses evolution, a controversial theory some
        scientists present as a scientific explanation for the origin of living
        things, such as plants, animals, and humans. 

        \highlight{No one was present} when life first appeared on earth.
        Therefore, any statement about life’s origins should be considered
        \highlight{as theory, not fact}.

        The word ``evolution'' may refer to many types of change. Evolution
        describes changes that occur within a species. (White moths, for
        example, may ``evolve'' into gray moths.) This process is
        microevolution, which can be observed and described as fact. 

        Evolution may also refer to the change of one living thing into
        another, such as reptiles into birds. \highlight{This process}, called
        macroevolution, \highlight{has never been observed and should be
            considered a theory}.
    \end{quote}
\end{frame}
\note[itemize]{
    \item Highlight these passages in your notes.
    \item Focus on diff of theory in everyday English v biology/science
    \item Tennessee 1926 was the Scopes trial = illegal to teach evolution
    \item Louisiana 1987 was equal time legislation struck down by the US
        Supreme Court; Edwards v Aguillard
    \item Washington 2002 is correct
    \item Pennsylvania 2005  Dover trial
    \item Additional note on nature of a theory: everyday English v use in

        theory, heliocentric theory of the solar system

            saw a virus until the 1950s.
        \item The atomic theory of matter was proposed in the early 1900s; no
            one saw an atom until the early 2000s.
