        \item In class yesterday, we found that in a population of tapeworms,
            the genotypes for gene $A$ were not in Hardy-Weinberg proportions;
            there were too few heterozygotes in the population. What can we
            conclude from this?

        \begin{clickeroptions}
            \item The heterozygotes have low fitness and are at low frequencies
                due to selection.
            \item There is non-random mating; homozygotes tend to mate with
                other homozygotes. 
            \item Homozygous individuals are immigrating from a different
                population of tapeworms.
            \item Genetic drift is changing the allele frequencies by chance.
            \item \clickeranswer{At least one of the assumptions of the
                    Hardy-Weinberg model is being violated in this population,
                    but we can't say for sure which one(s).}

            \item Genotypes of gene $B$ will also be out of Hardy-Weinberg

        \begin{clickeroptions}

                    selected for, whether or not they are ``better'' or more
                    complex.  E.g., evolution of less complexity (e.g., trait
                    loss) is extremely common}

                \nbox{\small ``Strong'' and ``socially dominant'' lack meaning for
                    most phenotypes in most environments. Even when they are
                    meaningful, they often don't increase reproductive success
                    (e.g., energy trade-offs, sneaker males)}

                (i.e., evolution is forward looking)

        \begin{clickeroptions}

            \item Species don't adapt---individuals do.
