    \begin{clickerquestion}
        \item Recent data suggest that some interbreeding occurred between
            \textit{H.\ sapiens} and \textit{H.\ neanderthalensis}. Does this
            mean that they are actually the same species? 

        \begin{clickeroptions}
            \item Yes---they were not reproductively isolated so they were not
                evolutionary independent units in nature. 
            \item Yes---both \textit{H.\ sapiens} and Neanderthals had
                language, buried their dead, used tools, and had other aspects
                of advanced culture.
            \item \clickeranswer{No---some interbreeding is common, and they
                    are separate phylogenetic and morphological species.}
            \item No---they've always been considered separate species.

        Darwin wanted to explain why, in some species, males look different than
        females.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item There is heritable variation in appearance and/or courtship
                behavior.

                \vspace{5mm}
            \item Individuals experience differential success in obtaining
                mates---individuals with certain traits do better.

                    mating increase in frequency.}

        In many species, females invest MUCH more in offspring than males do.
        For example:

        \vspace{4mm}
        Female red deer average 145 kg.\, and are pregnant for 6 months over
        the winter. Calves average 10 kg at birth and nurse for two months;
        they weigh about 55 kg at weaning.

        \vspace{8mm}
        Males average 200 kg, they contribute

            \item \clickeranswer{In most species, female RS is limited by
                    access to the resources required to breed.}
            \item In most species, male RS is limited by the ability to produce
                large amounts of sperm.

                obtain mates.

                \nbox{\scriptsize Males---note that modes are about the same,
                    but that males have a much wider distribution (= greater
                    variance).}

            \item In which sex would alleles associated with increased mating
                success increase faster?

                \nbox{\scriptsize Males---successful alleles can be passed on
                    to 20 or more offspring}

        Observation: In some human cultures, men control access to jobs and
        other resources required to start a family, and marriages are arranged.
        As a result, females have little or no ability to choose their mates. 

        \vspace{5mm}
        Question: In these cultures, how might men react to efforts to (1)
        increase the education level of women, or (2) help women start
        businesses through micro-lending or other programs? 

        \nbox{This is a discussion/opinion question \ldots but, answers should
            acknowledge that access to resources should increase the power that
            women have to choose their own males.}

        Observations:

            \item In the U.S., there is a strong correlation between
                level of educational attainment and lifetime income.
            
            \item Traditionally, men have been the family ``breadwinner.''

            \item Currently, 57\% of U.S.\ college students are female.
        \end{itemize}

        Question: In this culture, how might men and women react to the new
        asymmetry in level of education?

        \nbox{This is a discussion/opinion question \ldots but, answers should
            acknowledge that traditional roles may reverse or the correlation
            between education and income may break down.}

        Observation: In China in 1996, there were 121 boys aged 1--4 for every
        100 girls aged 1--4. This cohort is almost of marriageable age.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item How likely is it that all men in this cohort will
                be able to marry and have a family?
            
                \vspace{4mm}
            \item Will this situation make men happy or crabby?

                \vspace{4mm}
            \item Are they likely to remain celibate all their lives?

        \nbox{This is a discussion/opinion question \ldots but, answers should

                organ into the female.

            \item Then they do a somersault, which places their abdomen in
                front of the female's mouthparts.
