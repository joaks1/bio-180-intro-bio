    \begin{clickerquestion}
        \item Recent data suggest that limited interbreeding occurred between
            \textit{H.\ sapiens} and \textit{H.\ neanderthalensis}. Does this
            mean that they are actually the same species? 

        \begin{clickeroptions}
            \item Yes---they were not reproductively isolated so they were not
                evolutionary independent units in nature. 
            \item Yes---both \textit{H.\ sapiens} and Neanderthals had
                language, buried their dead, used tools, and had other aspects
                of advanced culture.
            \item \clickeranswer{No---with only a small amount of
                    interbreeding, unique differences (synapomorphies) between
                    the species will be maintained.}
            \item No---they've always been considered separate species.

        Observation: In some human cultures, men control access to jobs and
        other resources required to start a family, and marriages are arranged.
        As a result, females have little or no ability to choose their mates. 

        \vspace{5mm}
        Question: In these cultures, how might human behavioral ecology react
        to efforts to (1) increase the education level of women, or (2) help
        women start businesses through micro-lending or other programs? 

        \nbox{This is a discussion/opinion question \ldots but, answers should

            \item Traditionally, men have been the family ``breadwinner.''

            \item Currently, 57\% of U.S.\ college students are female.
        \end{itemize}

        Question: In this culture, how might this new asymmetry in level of
        education affect society (= human behavioral ecology)?

        \nbox{This is a discussion/opinion question \ldots but, answers should
