\section[How can we study evolution's Greatist Hits?]{Studying evolution's
    Greatest Hits}


\note{Status: First half of class we learned how evolution works---where
    heritable variation comes from, and how the forces evolution act on that
    variation to change the characteristics of populations through time. Now,
    we will talk about what evolution has produced---the diversity of life.
    Last, we will talk about ecology---how species produced by evolution
    interact with each other.}

                %     the host rock

            it?   
 
        \begin{clickeroptions}
            \item Conflict---fins and limbs have different functions, so they
                should arise from different genes. 
            \item Conflict---ray-finned fins don't have bones in a line like
                limbs, so they should arise from different genes. 
            \item Support---fins and limbs are both used in locomotion, so they
                should arise from homologous genes.
