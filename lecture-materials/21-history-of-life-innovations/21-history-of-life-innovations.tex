\section[Studying evolution's Greatest Hits]{How can we study evolution's
    Greatist Hits?}

\section[Importance of corroborating evidence]{Why is corroborating evidence
    from independent sources of data important?}

\note{Status: First half of class we learned how evolution works---where
    heritable variation comes from, and how the forces evolution act on that
    variation to change the characteristics of populations through time. Now,
    we will talk about what evolution has produced---the diversity of life.
    Last, we will talk about ecology---how species produced by evolution
    interact with each other.}
