        \item Olympic games, Berlin, 1936
        \item UW men's 8-oar rowing team won Olympic trials
        \item U.S.O.C.\ gave UW crew 1 week to raise \$5000 to pay for trip to
            Germany
        \item Despite being top qualifiers, they were given the worst lane
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Who got the two best lanes?
            \item Cost UW two boat lengths
        \end{itemize}
        \item The starter gave Germany and Italy unfair advantage (1.5 strokes)
        \item UW stroke was sick---lost 14 lbs; almost passed out
        \item UW lane was next to the stands of 70,000 German fans---the rowers
            couldn't hear the cox

    \begin{itemize}%[<+->]
        \item BIO 180/200/220 exams are short answer (2--3 sentences, making
            graphs, labeling, some single-word)
        \item Consider what it takes to excel on a multiple-choice test versus
            a short-answer exam. How does your level of understanding compare?
            \wbox{You have to be able to synthesize the correct answer, rather
                than simply identify it.}
        \item Why is it extremely common for instructors to hear, ``I
            understood the material so well, but I got a 47 on the exam?''
            \wbox{Because students are in the habit of only learning at the
                lower-level of Bloom's hierarchy}

            $\approx$3 hours of studying for every hour of class

            learner.''

        \item Why is it so difficult for students to change the way they study,
            in response to new demands?
            \wbox{Because, for 12+ years, they have mastered how to excel in

            works in a lab, and for each topic she asks me questions relevant
            to her research. This makes me apply the concepts from class in a

            good advice?

            re-read the text to make sure all the key concepts are fresh. Then
