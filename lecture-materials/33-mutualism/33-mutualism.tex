        \item Tobacco plants produce nicotine as a defense against
            caterpillars. On average, individuals that are induced to produce
            more nicotine make fewer seeds than non-induced individuals. Why is
            there a cost of defense from consumers---meaning, a fitness
            trade-off?

                scarce, the interaction becomes parasitic; the ants are
                benefiting from the honeydew, but the hoppers are not gaining
                the benefit of protection to offset the fitness cost of
                producing the honeydew.}
