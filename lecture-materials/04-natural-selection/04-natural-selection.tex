    \begin{clickerquestion}
        \item Which of the following experiments would be the best way to test
            the theory of evolution as formulated by Lamarck?
 
        \begin{clickeroptions}
            \item August Weismann kept mice in identical conditions in the lab
                for 22 generations. Each generation, he cut off their tails.

            \item Follow a population of mice over many generations and record
                (a) any changes that occur in the environment, and (b) any
                corresponding changes in mouse traits. 

            \item \clickeranswer{Keep a population of mice in cold conditions.
                    (In response, the mice will draw their tails up to conserve
                    heat.)  Continue for many generations. Measure tail length
                    each generation.}

            \item Keep a population of mice under identical conditions in the
                lab. Each generation, only allow the mice with the shortest
                tails to breed.

    \wbox{Weisman actually did this! But, \#3 is more Lamarckian, because
        the mice are making an effort}

    Darwin’s four postulates explain why/how evolution occurs

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item<2-> Individuals within populations are variable
            \vspace{1cm}

        \item<2-> Some of these variations are passed on to offspring
            \vspace{1cm}

        \item<2-> Not all individuals produce the same number of offspring
            \vspace{1cm}

        \item<2-> Individuals with certain heritable traits produce the most
            offspring

    \end{enumerate}
    \wbox{For each postulate, find example from finches in the textbook, and
        think about how you would test it?}

        individuals, not transforming individuals}

    For any example of change in the characteristics of a population or species
    through time, you should be able to explain how it could happen based on: 

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item<2-> \highlight{Heritable variation} in the trait in question, and 

        \item<3-> \highlight{Differential reproductive success}, based on
            variation in the trait in question (in the context of the
            \highlight{environment}!)

    \uncover<2->{
    Natural selction an evolutionary process was controversial until 1930s.
    }

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item<3-> Selection will exhaust variation; Why?
            \wbox{\footnotesize Advantageous alleles will go to fixation, then no more
                variation and no more evolution}
            % \vspace{2mm}
        \item<4-> Blending inheritance will eliminate new, advantageous variants; why?
            \wbox{\footnotesize New, rare advantageous variants will blend with the
                common forms of the traits and dilute the advantage---this will
                occur generation after generation until the advantageous trait
                disappears.}
