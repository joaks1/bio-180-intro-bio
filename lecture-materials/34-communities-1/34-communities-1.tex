        \item Pollination is a well-studied mutualism. For example, yucca moths
            lay their eggs in the seeds of yucca plants, and their larva eat
            some of the seeds; yucca moths are the only pollinator of yucca
            flowers (overall, both parties benefit).  However, some species of
            yucca moth lack the specialized mouthparts required to transfer
            pollen, but still lay their eggs in yucca seeds. How would you
            characterize this interaction?

\section{Community structure}

\begin{frame}[t]
    \begin{adjustwidth}{-2em}{-1.5em}
        \textbf{Community} = the collection of species in a particular area.

        \vspace{4mm}
        These species interact via:
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Mutualism
            \item Competition
            \item Consumption
            \item Commensalism
        \end{itemize}

        Key idea with coevolution and arms races:

        \begin{itemize}

                interacts with (and vice versa). An allele in one species can
                change the selection on alleles of other species (and vice
                versa). Thus, adaptation in one species is contingent on the
                adaptations of its interacting species.}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item The species present in an area are there because they ``have
                to be''; their niches comprise a highly integrated,

        \begin{itemize}
            \item The species present in an area are there because they
                ``happen to be''; community composition is largely due to
                chance events (history).

        \begin{clickeroptions}

        \end{itemize}
        
        In which environment are ``niche'' vs.\ ``random'' processes more

        \nbox{Niche processes (Clements' hypothesis) is more important on Mount
            St.\ Helens (the adaptations of species will be very important in
            determining what species can colonize such a harsh environment).
            Random processes (Gleason's hypothesis) is more important in

        Based on the evidence to date (and in the reading), which hypothesis

        How does disturbance affect communities?

        \vspace{2mm}
        \textbf{Disturbance} = any change that removes biomass.

        \vspace{2mm}
        Types of disturbance:
        \nbox{Fire, flood, wind, volcanism, logging, landslide, tree fall,
            etc.}

    \end{adjustwidth}

    \note[item]{What is biomass? The amount of organic material}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]
    \begin{adjustwidth}{-2em}{-1.5em}
        To understand disturbance, you need to analyze:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Type \cmask{What biomass and how removed?}
            \item Severity \cmask{How much biomass removed?}
            \item Frequency \cmask{How often does it occur?}
        \end{enumerate}

        \begin{uncoverenv}<2->
        Examples:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Boreal forests burn to the ground every 100--300 years

                \vspace{4mm}
            \item Grasslands and savannas: fires every 2--3 years.

                \vspace{4mm}
            \item Freshwater systems: annual flooding.

                \vspace{4mm}
            \item Tropical and temperate rainforests: frequently, gaps in
                forest are created by fallen trees (windblown or diseased).
        \end{itemize}
        \end{uncoverenv}

        Humans have prevented these natural disturbances.  How would you mimic
        these disturbances?

    \begin{adjustwidth}{-2em}{-1.5em}
        Consider species from fire-prone ecosystems. How are the traits below
        adaptive?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Lodgepole pines require full sun to thrive, and their cones
                are sealed shut with resin.
                
                \nbox{Fire melts resin, seeds fall and sprout. Only release
                    seeds when conditions are best (no competitors around; lots
                    of sun).}

            \item In most prairie (grassland) plants, the stem cells
                responsible for new growth are located below ground.

                \nbox{Plants can survive and regrow after a fire.}

            \item Some species in California chaparral have seeds that must be
                exposed to smoke/ash to germinate.

                \nbox{Fire makes space and removes competitors. Seeds only
                    germinate and grow when conditions are best (no competitors
                    around; lots of sun).}

            \item Burr oak trees have extraordinarily thick bark compared to
                other oak species of similar size.

                \nbox{Tissues are protected from fire and heat inside the thick

        \vspace{4mm}
        To study how and why succession occurs at a particular location, we

        Species interactions; key observations:

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Early successional species alter the physical environment in
                ways that favor (facilitate) late successional species.

                \nbox{Early successional species are good dispersers (they have
                    to get there!), and grow quickly and reproduce in harsh
                    conditions with very little nutrients/water. They can do
                    this by investing very little in biomass and survivorship,
                    and a lot in reproduction.  After enough of them colonize,
                    they create shade, hold in moisture, and add organic
                    nutrients to the soil---they facilitate conditions that are
                    good for late successional species.}

            \item Once basic resources are available (moisture/organic
                nutrients), late successional species are much better
