        \item It turns out that
            (1) most quantitative traits are due to the action of dozens of genes
            (2) some of these genes have much larger effects than others, and
            (3) their effects may not be additive (there can be gene $\times$
            gene interactions).

                an equal amount to the individual's phenotype.
            \item Quantitative traits are ``genetically determined''---meaning
                the environment has no affect on them.
            \item Almost all quantitative variation is due to variation in the
                environments experienced by individuals.
