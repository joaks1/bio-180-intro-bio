        \item We find a species of plant in which some individuals have yellow
            seeds and others have green seeds.
        \item This species of plant is closely related to the garden peas that
            Mendel used.
        \item Luckily enough, some plant breeders have already bred pure lines
            for each seed color.
        \item We cross individuals from yellow-seeded and green-seeded pure
            lines, and all of the \f{1} progeny have yellow seeds.
        \item The plant breeders tell us that when they cross \f{1}s with
            pure-line green-seeded individuals, they sometimes see more yellow
            seeds than they expect.
        \item The breeders hypothesize that heterozygotes produce more gametes
            with the yellow allele than the green allele.

                meiosis.

    We were able to reject the null hypothesis of simple Mendelian
    inheritance. So, what now? \\

    \vspace{8mm}
    Our alternative hypothesis was that heterozygotes produce more gametes with
    the yellow allele than the green allele. \\

    \vspace{8mm}
    What is the next step? How do we continue to advance science? \\

    \nbox{We need to come up with a \highlight{mechanism} for the alternative
        hypothesis that allows us to make precise predictions about the data we
        should see if it is correct. This would make the alternative hypothesis
