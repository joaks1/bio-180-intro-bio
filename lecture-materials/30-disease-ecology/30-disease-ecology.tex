                How is the incidence of Lyme disease changing in this region?

                    \nbox{\scriptsize It is increasing}

                Do the data support the traditional hypothesis that Lyme
                disease incidence is controlled by deer population density?

                    \nbox{\scriptsize No. The abundance of deer is not changing
                        (or slightly declining) while the incidence of the
                        disease is increasing}

                Mice also host the bacterium that causes Lyme disease.  Fox eat
                mice. Coyotes eat fox.  How do these observations help explain
                the data?

                    \nbox{\scriptsize The increase in coyotes is causing a
                        decline in foxes. This could be causing an increase in
                        mouse populations, which in turn is increasing the rate
                        of transmission to humans}

                What environmental changes by humans would explain these data?

                    \nbox{\scriptsize Humans have removed top predators, like
                        wolves, that would compete with, and eat, coyotes.} }
