        How do the following processes affect genetic diversity and fitness of
        populations, as they become smaller and more isolated?

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Inbreeding depression
            
                \nbox{\scriptsize In small isolated populations, more
                    deleterious recessive alleles are expressed as homozygosity
                    increases. This lowers the average fitness of the
                    population. Selection will remove such alleles at a higher
                    rate, which will decrease genetic diversity.}

            \item Genetic drift

                \nbox{\scriptsize In small isolated populations, alleles will
                    be lost or fixed at a higher rate do to larger random
                    changes in allele frequencies each generation. Most
                    mutations are deleterious, and more of them will fix due to
                    chance, so the average fitness will decrease.}
        \end{itemize}

        How will changes in the environment affect the fitness of populations
        as they become smaller and more isolated?

        \nbox{\scriptsize As the environment changes, there will be less
            genetic diversity due to the processes above. As genetic diversity
            decreases, the probability that the population will contain alleles
            with high fitness in the new environment decreases. So, the average
            fitness will tend to decrease.}

        How can this lead to an ``extinction vortex''?

        \nbox{\scriptsize As populations become small and isolated, all the
            mechanisms above will lead to decreasing genetic diversity and
            fitness. Thus, the population will likely become even smaller,
            which will increase the intensity of the above mechanisms, which
            will make the population shrink even more, and so on and so on.
            Also, as the population shrinks, random disturbances (fires,
            floods, disease outbreaks, etc.) have a larger affect.}
