Advisor: Adam Summers

I am interested in the evolutionary arms race between shelled organisms
(snails, bivalves, crustaceans, etc.)  and their predators.

Advisor: Peter Ward

My research interest is in the evolution and extinction of plants. In
particular I am interested in the role that Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) plays in
these processes.  Currently I am studying the effects of H2S on plant growth,
survivability and the photosystems.

Advisor: Sharlene Santana

Now as a new graduate student in the Santana lab I hope to expand my research
beyond feeding mechanics and investigate morphological diversity as it relates
to prey acquisition techniques and resource use in Neotropical bats.

Advisor: Chris T. Amemiya

He is working on a project involving programmed genome rearrangement in the sea
lamprey.

Advisor: Sharlene Santana

As a graduate student in Biology at UW, I will be studying the relationship
between morphology and ecology in diverse clades of mammals, and how patterns
of biodiversity result from major morphological adaptations. I am particularly
interested in how skeletal morphology is indicative of feeding ecology and
locomotor behavior, which I plan to investigate using a variety of structural
and dynamic analysis techniques.
